### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pourup-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (copy from `env.example`):

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=pourup_db
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_change_this_in_production
JWT_EXPIRE=7d

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# File Upload Configuration
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880
UPLOAD_PATH=uploads/

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

# CORS Configuration
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3001
```

### 4. Database Setup

1. **Create MySQL Database:**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE pourup_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

2. **Run Setup Script:**
```bash
npm run setup
```

This will:
- Create all database tables
- Set up initial Super Admin and sample Winery Admin accounts
- Create the uploads directory
- Verify database connection

### 5. Start the Server

**Development Mode:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production Mode:**
```bash
